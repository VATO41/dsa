    <p><i><b>lorem ipsun</b>is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown <br>printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining <br>essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <u><mark>1960s</mark></u> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software <br>like Aldus PageMaker including versions <b>of Lorem Ipsum.</b></i></p>
        <p><b>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't <br>look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. "All the <br>Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet". It uses a dictionary of over 200 <br>Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free <br>from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</b></p>
